What do I want to get done in next couple of days?

- create renderer
- get out of localhost
- create composable, excalidraw-like editor that can render UI, show console
  logs
- run mistral locally
- run mistral locally with per token loop
- run a mistral lora locally
- deploy analytics engine in retune
- have AI build a landing page
- have AI build a chatbot app

## render

- inline the modules
- hydrate the client component
- re-create the readable stream in frontend

---

Make it work, then make it better.
